{"title": "Meta Post : {{ Hello again, Humans ! }}", "body": "Hello all,  *(Message to the mods: this is a Meta post, please contact me if something is wrong!)*  # The goodreads-bot Legacy  As you must know if you were already here last year, our beloved bot u/goodreadsbot stopped working in January after having been used **156.631** times on this subreddit by a total of **25.272** different users, because goodreads shut down API access.  As a bored nerd and fellow reader, I decided to start a new toy project: rise our bot back! But because the Goodreads API is now closed, the first task was to build my own Books database... which I did, using Reddit, Goodreads & Google Books.  This new bot called u/goodreads-rebot (\"bot\" + \"reboot\" = \"rebot\".....) is open source (link to source code below). I wanted to thank u/ArtyomR, the author of u/goodreadsbot, for the original idea. I am not u/ArtyomR, but I have great respect for his/her work and its legacy. Thank you!  # How does it work? Just like before! (with more features)  Write `{{Harry Potter}} in your post` or alternatively `{{A Little Life by Hanya Yaniagara}} (notice the typo)` with a **\"by\"**  and the bot will answer with more information about the **book** or the **series**.  The search part is now part of the bot (and not on Goodreads API side), and was quite challenging to handle. **You definitely should specify the author with the \"by\" keyword**, because it helps the Database search.   **Examples:**  `You should read {{Harry Potter}} !` will work, it will recognize it as the name of a **Series**, in that case it will provide information about **the first book of the Series;**  `My favorite book is {{Call Me By Your Name}}` will work too, the bot will try to find a book called **Call Me** by author named **Your Name** (because of the \"by\" keyword...) but it will fail to find one, so as a 2nd try because it's not *that* dumb, it will indeed find a book called **Call Me By Your Name** :)  `Did you read {{1984 by Michael Radford}}?` (notice the wrong author): it will work too even if the author is wrong, because when the search fails using the author, it will try again ignoring it.  # Features  I added a \"Top 2 recommended-along\" section, featuring the 2 books that were the most recommended here on Reddit in the same threads than the book described. It is based on another toy project of mine (\ud83d\ude05), a book recommending algorithm I am working on, which is based on the co-occurences of book titles in Reddit threads. Let me know if you find this new information useful.  # Limitations  As explained before, the bot is based on a book database I build and update as much as I can. The search will sometimes fail to match some existing books, in particular very niche books, or the recent ones. I am working on having the best and up-to-date database as possible, meanwhile sorry for the misses!  Also, the bot is currently not running on other subreddits (like r/booksuggestions), but because the code is really modular, it's just about configurations. FYI this is in the roadmap for the next few days/weeks.  Finally, I may reach some rate posting limits because of low karma. Hopefully, this will be solved soon after some time thanks to your help :)  You will find below more information (links being forbidden in posts).  I think that's it.

It\u2019s soaked in realism and emotional complexity, with just the right tension between success and envy.\n\n**2.** ***The Art of Fielding*** **by Chad Harbach**  \nYes, it\u2019s about baseball, but not *really*. It\u2019s about driven, obsessive people colliding at a small college, with themes of talent, identity, and the pressure to live up to your own mythology. Very emotionally layered, like *T&T&T*.\n\n**3.** ***Startup*** **by Doree Shafrir**  \nLeans harder into satire, but gives a sharp, inside look at startup culture, tech ambition, and the blurry ethics that sometimes come with success. Think of it as *T&T&T*'s snarky cousin.\n\n**4.** ***The Ensemble*** **by Aja Gabel**  \nFollows a string quartet over decades. The dynamic between the four musicians is tender, messy, competitive, and intimate. If you loved the creative entanglement in *T&T&T*, this hits similar emotional notes in a different world.\n\n**5.** ***Version Control*** **by Dexter Palmer**  \nA brilliant and strange literary sci-fi about time, memory, and relationships, set in a tech-adjacent future. It plays with time both literally and emotionally, and it\u2019s packed with smart, flawed people trying to make meaning out of ambition and love.\n\nThat blend of big feelings and big ideas isn\u2019t easy to find, but when you do, it *really* lands.

I'd suggest reading The Rise and Fall of the Neoliberal Order to understand why so many people in this country have grievances and why the root of those grievances might have some logic.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, \"Neoliberal\" does not necessarily imply \"Liberal\" in the American political sense. Arguably, the US political landscape was solidly Neoliberal from 1980 to 2016, from Reagan to Obama. \n\nThe book's central argument is that that era's globalist, free-market policies made everything seem great for one subset of our country while being a net negative for another subset. The former subset was better represented in popular culture, which gave the impression that America was improving for everyone. Furthermore, the latter subset lived in areas and had jobs that were not considered \"desirable,\" so their losses were easy to shrug off as \"progress.\"\n\nThis led to a massive backlash against both Republicans and Democrats (remember, both parties were Neoliberal) and allowed a third political movement to take over the Republican Party.

It walks through reconnecting with your inner child and gives you tools to begin healing those invisible wounds.

Especially helpful if you\u2019ve struggled with shame or self-sabotage.\n\n**3.** ***The Body Keeps the Score*** **by Bessel van der Kolk**  \nA modern classic. It\u2019s about how trauma, big or small, lives in the body\u2014and how to work with it instead of against it. Some chapters are heavy, but it gives language to things a lot of us never knew how to describe.\n\n**4.** ***Untamed*** **by Glennon Doyle**  \nThis one may seem unexpected, but if you want a voice that says \"you\u2019re allowed to rebuild everything from scratch\" with vulnerability and grit, this hits. It\u2019s not just for women\u2014it's for anyone tired of pretending.\n\n**5.** ***Healing the Shame that Binds You*** **by John Bradshaw**  \nSince you\u2019re diving into SLAA and recovery from infidelity, this one might be especially useful. It breaks down how shame drives compulsive behaviors and how to dismantle that cycle.\n\nYou said half your life feels like it's over, but here's the truth: everything you're doing now? Most people never get there, *ever*. If anything, this is the beginning of your real life.

As well as blitzed and the other books by that author.    Thank you I appreciate it.", "comments": ["The Theory and Practice of Hell: The German Concentration Camps and the System Behind Them", "\"The nearest any of this came to prefiguring Nazi ideology was in the writings of Alfred Ploetz, who spiced his theories with a strong dose of antisemitism and collaborated with Nordic supremacist groups\u2026 Ploetz took a ruthlessly meritocratic line on eugenic planning, arguing, for example, that a panel of doctors should attend all births and determine whether the baby was fit to survive or should be killed as weak and inadequate. The Darwinist Alexander Tille openly advocated the killing of the mentally and physically unfit, and agreed with Ploetz and Schallmayer that children\u2019s illnesses should be left untreated so that the weak could be eliminated from the chain of heredity. In 1905 Ploetz and his sometime brother-in-law, the like-minded Ernst R\u00fcdin, founded the Racial Hygiene Society to propagate their views. It rapidly gained influence in the medical and welfare professions...\n\n\u201cBy the eve of the First World War, their ideas had spread in one form or another to areas such as medicine, social work, criminology and the law. Social deviants such as prostitutes, alcoholics, petty thieves, vagrants and the like were increasingly regarded as hereditarily tainted, and calls amongst experts for such people to be forcibly sterilized had become too loud to escape attention. Such was the influence of these ideas on the welfare establishment that even the Social Democrats could take seriously the proposal of Alfred Grotjahn to link housing and welfare improvements with the compulsory sterilization of the insane, the \u2018workshy\u2019 and the alcoholic.\n\n\u201cDevelopments such as these reflected the growing influence of the medical profession over rapidly growing specialisms such as criminology and social work. The triumphs of German medical science in discovering the bacilli that caused diseases such as cholera and tuberculosis in the nineteenth century had given it unparalleled intellectual prestige as well as inadvertently furnishing antisemites with a whole new language in which to express their hatred and fear of the Jews. As a result, it had brought about a widespread medicalization of society, in which ordinary people, including an increasing proportion of the working class, had begun to adopt hygienic practices such as washing regularly, disinfecting bathrooms, boiling drinking water and so on. The concept of hygiene began to spread from medicine to other areas of life, including not only \u2018social hygiene\u2019 but also, crucially, \u2018racial hygiene\u2019.\n\n\u201cTo be sure ... the effect that such ideas had on government policies and their implementation before 1914 was not very great, \\[but there were propagandists for the breeding of a blond, Aryan super-race\\] ...\n\n\u201c\\[T\\]he emergence of these ideas, together with the increasing role they played in public debate, was a significant element in the origins of Nazi ideology. Several fundamental principles united virtually everyone in this motley crowd of scientists, doctors and propagandists for racial hygiene. The first was that heredity played a significant role in determining human character and behaviour. The second, which followed on from this, was that society, led by the state, should manage the population in order to increase national efficiency. The \u2018fit\u2019 had to be persuaded, or forced, to breed more, the \u2018unfit\u2019 to breed less. Thirdly, however these terms were understood, the racial hygiene movement introduced an ominously rational and scientific categorization of people into those who were \u2018valuable\u2019 to the nation and those who were not. \u2018Low quality\u2019 - the German term was *minderwertig*, literally, \u2018worth-less\u2019\u2014became a stock term used by social workers and medical men for many kinds of social deviant before the First World War. By labelling people in this way, the race hygienists opened the way towards the control, the abuse and finally the extermination of the \u2018valueless\u2019 by the state, through measures such as forcible sterilization and even execution, which some of them at least were already advocating before 1914. Finally, such a technocratically rationalistic approach to population management presupposed an entirely secular, instrumental approach to morality. Christian precepts such as the sanctity of marriage and parenthood, or the equal value of every being endowed with an immortal soul, were thrown out of the window. Whatever else such ideas were, they were not traditional or backward-looking. Indeed, some of their proponents, such as Ludwig Woltmann and Wilhelm Schallmayer, thought of themselves as being on the left rather than the right of the political spectrum\u2026 Fundamentally, racial hygiene was born of a new drive for society to be governed by scientific principles irrespective of all other considerations. It represented a new variant of German nationalism, one which was never likely to be shared by conservatives or reactionaries, or endorsed by the Christian Churches or indeed by any form of organized or established religion.\u00a0\n\n\u201cBoth antisemitism and racial hygiene were to be key components of Nazi ideology. They were both part of a general secularization of thought in the late nineteenth century\u201d (pp. 36-8, ***The Coming of the Third Reich*** **by Richard J. Evans**).", "Who is downvoting your comment? That's ridiculous", "\u201cBoth antisemitism and racial hygiene were to be key components of Nazi ideology\u2026. Nietzsche was a vigorous opponent of antisemitism, he was deeply critical of the vulgar worship of power and success which had resulted (in his view) from the unification of Germany by military force in 1871, and his most famous concepts, such as the \u2018will to power\u2019 and the \u2018superman\u2019 were intended by him to apply only to the sphere of thought and ideas, not to politics or action. But the power of his prose allowed such phrases to be reduced all too easily to slogans, ripped from their philosophical context and applied in ways of which he would have greatly disapproved. His concept of an ideal human being, freed from moral constraints and triumphing through will-power over the weak, could be appropriated without too much difficulty by those who believed, as he did not, in the breeding of the human race according to racial and eugenic criteria. Central to such interpretations was the influence of his sister Elisabeth Forster, who vulgarized and popularized his ideas, emphasizing their brutal, elitist aspects \u2026. Writers such as Ernst Bertram, Alfred Baumler and Hans Gunther reduced Nietzsche to a prophet of power. and his concept of the superman to a plea for the coming of a great German leader unfettered by moral constraints or Christian theology.\n\n\u201cOthers, drawing on German anthropological studies of indigenous societies in New Guinea and other parts of the German colonial empire, took Nietzsche\u2019s spiritual elitism a step further and called for the creation of a new society ruled by a band of brothers, an elite of vigorous young men who would rule the state rather like a medieval knightly brotherhood In this deeply misogynistic view of the world, women would have no role to play except to breed the elite of the future, a belief shared in less radical ways by many of the eugenicists and racial hygienists. Academic writers like Heinrich Schurtz propagated the ideology of the band of brothers through a variety of publications, but it had its greatest effect in areas such as the youth movement, in which young, mostly middleclass men devoted themselves to hiking, communing with nature, singing nationalist songs around camp fires and pouring scorn on the staid politics, hypocritical morality and social artificiality of the adult world. Writers such as Hans Blither, strongly influenced by the youth movement, went to even greater extremes in their plea for the state to be reorganized along anti-democratic lines and led by a close-knit group of heroic men \u2026 Advocates of such ideas already began to found pseudo-monastic, conspiratorial organizations before the First World War, notably the Germanic Order, established in 1912. In the world of such tiny secular sects, \u2018Aryan\u2019 symbolism and ritual played a central role, as their members reclaimed runes and sunworship as essential signs of Germanness, and adopted the Indian symbol of the swastika as an \u2018Aryan\u2019 device, under the influence of the Munich poet Alfred Schuler and the race theorist Lanz von Liebenfels, who flew a swastika flag from his castle in Austria in 1907. Strange though ideas like these were, their influence on many young middle-class men who passed through the youth movement organizations before the First World War should not be underestimated. If nothing else, they contributed to a widespread revolt against bourgeois convention in the generation born in the 1890s and 1900s (pp. 39-40, ***The Coming of the Third Reich*** **by Richard J. Evans).**", "\u201c\\[T\\]he Nazi regime systematically murdered only three groups of human beings: the handicapped, Jews, and Gypsies\u201d (p. xiii).\n\nEugenics was believed to be a state-of-the-art science in 1930s Germany(p. 7).\n\n\u201cDuring the period of the Empire and the Weimar Republic, support for eugenics came from all political parties \u2013 conservative, liberal and even socialist\u201d (p. 10).\n\nAlfred Grotjahn was a Social Democrat and leading eugenicist Karl Keutsky the leading theoretician of German Social Democracy were against leaving abortion decisions to individual women as \u201cun-socialist.\u201d Those on the left favored \u201cLamarckian approach to eugenics while those on the right, as well as some on the left, adhered strictly to a Mendelian approach.\u201d\u00a0 Lamarck = genetics + environment; Mendel = genetics not influenced by environment (p. 10).\n\n\u201cGerman \u2018race hygiene\u2019 succeeded in imposing on society its radical vision of a biological-social utopia\u201d (p. 16).\n\n\u00a0Voluntary sterilization programs began under the Weimar government.\u00a0 Nazis made sterilization mandatory for the disabled (p. 18).\n\n***The Origins of Nazi Genocide: From Euthanasia to the Final Solution*** **by Henry Friedlander.**\n\n\\+\n\nHitler was much more influenced by the works of Karl Marx and Charles Darwin than he was antebellum American Southerners.

A political lure, to unite haters.  And what's most weird about it is, it unites haters by accusing others of hatred.  \"Look at them, they hate the Jews, they must be fascist!\"  \"Look at them, they hate immigrants, they must be fascist!\"  Et cetera.  So justifying hatred on the left by suggesting it -- irrespective of reality -- on the right.\n\nIn order to face reality, you need to understand that fascism has a great deal in common with many other so called socially constructed topics.  Democracy, intelligence, racism, the list is long.  And what all these topics have in common is:  you can't tell what they are without studying them, and you can't study them without first knowing what they are.\n\nIt's a dilemma.  How do you study fascism without first knowing what it is?  How do you know you studied the right thing?  But how could you ever find out what it is without first studying it?\n\nI don't think social scientists have ever faced this issue directly or straightforwardly.  Although, if you'd like an example of how to face a similar issue directly, I think there's a 20th anniversary or 25th anniversary edition of The Bell Curve that tries to do that, with intelligence.  (Oddly, the book has a great deal to say about racism, and never once do the authors seem to notice that it, too, carries with it the same dilemma.)\n\nAnother very interesting characteristic of these so called socially constructed topics is, in order to be real they must be topics about which we must be able to be mistaken.  Or to put it another way, if a topic is real by definition it doesn't exist in the world, but only in our heads.  To be real in the world it must be something about which we may not have seen everything it has to offer us.\n\nI'm sadly not enough of a philosopher to be able to explore that idea more carefully, but let's imagine that we have investigated the evidence and decided, one and all, that fascism is a real thing, out in the world.  The evidence, as they say, is conclusive.  Now.  If it's a real thing, it must also be something about which we might be mistaken.  That's how you really know it's real, is if you had to change your mind about what it was, while you studied it.  Right?  So if you had to change your mind about it once, how do you know there aren't a hundred or a thousand other tests, which you could run but haven't thought of (much less executed) which would change your conception of it just as much if not more?\n\nAnd for all I know, one or many of these tests we haven't even thought of yet might convince us that it's actually NOT a real thing in the world, but contained entirely in our heads.  Right?  We don't know.  We haven't done the tests.\n\nThe bottom line, for me, is:  don't expect to understand it.  You can learn what people think they mean by the word... but I don't think you can know much more than that.", "I'm reading this right now it's excellent"], "suggested_books": ["The Origins of Totalitarianism", "Blackshirts and reds", "The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements"], "score": 0, "id": "1jmqcl3", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/1jmqcl3/best_book_to_learn_more_about_fascism/"}
