    "query": "Meta Post : {{ Hello again, Humans ! }} Hello all,  *(Message to the mods: this is a Meta post, please contact me if something is wrong!)*  # The goodreads-bot Legacy  As you must know if you were already here last year, our beloved bot u/goodreadsbot stopped working in January after having been used **156.631** times on this subreddit by a total of **25.272** different users, because goodreads shut down API access.  As a bored nerd and fellow reader, I decided to start a new toy project: rise our bot back! But because the Goodreads API is now closed, the first task was to build my own Books database... which I did, using Reddit, Goodreads & Google Books.  This new bot called u/goodreads-rebot (\"bot\" + \"reboot\" = \"rebot\".....) is open source (link to source code below). I wanted to thank u/ArtyomR, the author of u/goodreadsbot, for the original idea. I am not u/ArtyomR, but I have great respect for his/her work and its legacy. Thank you!  # How does it work? Just like before! (with more features)  Write `{{Harry Potter}} in your post` or alternatively `{{A Little Life by Hanya Yaniagara}} (notice the typo)` with a **\"by\"**  and the bot will answer with more information about the **book** or the **series**.  The search part is now part of the bot (and not on Goodreads API side), and was quite challenging to handle. **You definitely should specify the author with the \"by\" keyword**, because it helps the Database search.   **Examples:**  `You should read {{Harry Potter}} !` will work, it will recognize it as the name of a **Series**, in that case it will provide information about **the first book of the Series;**  `My favorite book is {{Call Me By Your Name}}` will work too, the bot will try to find a book called **Call Me** by author named **Your Name** (because of the \"by\" keyword...) but it will fail to find one, so as a 2nd try because it's not *that* dumb, it will indeed find a book called **Call Me By Your Name** :)  `Did you read {{1984 by Michael Radford}}?` (notice the wrong author): it will work too even if the author is wrong, because when the search fails using the author, it will try again ignoring it.  # Features  I added a \"Top 2 recommended-along\" section, featuring the 2 books that were the most recommended here on Reddit in the same threads than the book described. It is based on another toy project of mine (\ud83d\ude05), a book recommending algorithm I am working on, which is based on the co-occurences of book titles in Reddit threads. Let me know if you find this new information useful.  # Limitations  As explained before, the bot is based on a book database I build and update as much as I can. The search will sometimes fail to match some existing books, in particular very niche books, or the recent ones. I am working on having the best and up-to-date database as possible, meanwhile sorry for the misses!  Also, the bot is currently not running on other subreddits (like r/booksuggestions), but because the code is really modular, it's just about configurations. FYI this is in the roadmap for the next few days/weeks.  Finally, I may reach some rate posting limits because of low karma. Hopefully, this will be solved soon after some time thanks to your help :)  You will find below more information (links being forbidden in posts).  I think that's it.   See you there!",

    "query": "Fantasy for a non-fantasy reader Hey all!  I read both fiction and non-fiction, but when it comes to fiction, I tend to avoid fantasy. I enjoy romance, crime, drama - basically anything as long as it feels grounded in reality. I\u2019m not entirely sure why fantasy has never appealed to me, but I think it\u2019s partly because I worry the worlds will be too complex to understand, and I find that fantasy has to be particularly well-written to maintain my suspension of disbelief. I also tend to connect more with stories when they feel like something that could actually happen.  That being said, I\u2019m going through a rough time mentally and could really use a book that lets me escape into a different world - something immersive, engaging, and that I can\u2019t put down. I don\u2019t want anything with a super complex world or lore, just an easy-to-get-into story that still feels captivating. Ideally, it wouldn\u2019t have any heavy or dark themes - I know cozy has been overused lately but\u2026 yeah that\u2019s the vibe I\u2019m looking for. It can be a standalone or a series.  If it is any help, the only fantasy books I remember enjoying were the Stardust series by Linda Chapman, which I read as a kid. I liked that it had a fantasy element and some suspense while still being set in the \u201creal world\u201d (maybe I should reread it now at 27? \ud83d\ude05)  I know this is a bit vague, but I\u2019d love any recommendations you think might fit.

Now I have 7 credits and no particular book I\u2019m excited about.   I know there\u2019s an audiobook sub and I\u2019ll post there too, but I always get the best book recs from this sub so I\u2019m hoping for some great options.  Here are some books/genres/authors I love:  - **Nonfiction: history and politics**. Interwar Europe and later. I have all Michael Short books, and pretty much anything that\u2019s been written about Moussolini, Hitler, and Putin.  - **Nonfiction: space, quantum physics, philosophy**. I love space and the \u201cbig\u201d mysteries - the relativity of time, what\u2019s on the other side of black holes, how will the universe die?  - **Nonfiction: Corporate true crime**.  Bad Blood, Empire of Pain, The Big Short, etc.   - **Fiction: Dystopia/apocalypse/post-apocalypse.** If a TV show or movie has been made of the book, I\u2019ve read it (examples: Silo, Wayward Pines, Hunger Games, Handmaid\u2019s Tale, The Stand), but I\u2019d love suggestions for a bit more obscure recs  - **Fiction: Literary masterworks**. Not sure how to describe this one, but books that you think should be considered classic or exceptional because of the writing itself. Examples include The Three Body Problem, American War, books by Ben Winters.",

Omar El Akkad's *American War* is another great example of utilizing the genre's talent of criticizing today's problems from a bitter, post-modern edge to the lore and the protagonists' struggles.   This week, I want to try reading post-post apocalyptic books. The age of rebuilding society bit by bit, the overcoming of the zombie apocalypse or at least the twilight years of it. Or an antiquity age of the dark age before, maybe hinted at through dialogue or small breadcrumbs to the discerning loreslueth. The Fallout New Vegas experience, in other words.
